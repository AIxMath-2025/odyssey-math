{"Problem_1": {"question": "Let $S=\\left\\{ 1,2,\\cdots 2024 \\right\\}$, if the set of any $n$ pairwise prime numbers in $S$ has at least one prime number, the minimum value of $n$ is \\underline{\\hspace{2cm}}.", "answer": "16", "reasoning": "Taking the 15 numbers 1, 22, 32, ..., 432 violates the condition. Furthermore, since $S$ does not contain any non-prime numbers with a minimum prime factor of at least 47, there are only 14 types of non-prime numbers in $S$, excluding 1. Applying the Pigeonhole Principle, we conclude that $n=16$.", "label": "Algebra", "level": "high school competition"}}
{"Problem_2": {"question": "Four positive integers satisfy $a^3=b^2$, $c^5=d^4$, and $c-a=77$. Then, $d-b=$ \\underline{\\hspace{2cm}}.", "answer": "235", "reasoning": "Given the conditions, we can assume $a^3=b^2=x^6$ and $c^5=d^4=y^{20}$, which yields $y^4-x^2=(y^2-x)(y^2+x)=77$. Hence, we find that $y= 3, ~x= 2, ~d- b= 243- 8= 235.$", "label": "Algebra", "level": "high school competition"}}
